NanoOK
======

NanoOK RT (the real-time metagenomic analysis tool) is now superseded by MARTi - see http://marti.readthedocs.io for details.

The original NanoOK (a tool for alignment-based analysis of nanopore data) has fallen behind nanopore file format changes a little. It can be made to work, but requires patience. We have a replacement tool in development, but can't offer an anticipated date at the moment. Unfortunately, we're not funded to develop it, so it's a spare time activity.

NanoOK documentation can be found at http://nanook.readthedocs.io/
